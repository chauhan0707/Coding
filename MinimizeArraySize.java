Problem Statement: Find minimum possible size of array with given rules for removing elements

Description: Given an array of numbers and a constant k, minimize size of array with following rules for removing elements.
Exactly three elements can be removed at one go.
The removed three elements must be adjacent in array, i.e., arr[i], arr[i+1], arr[i+2]. And the second element must be k greater than first and third element must be k greater than second, i.e., arr[i+1] â€“ arr[i] = k and arr[i+2]-arr[i+1] = k.

Testcses that both solutions were tested against:
Input: arr[] = {100, 101, 105, 2, 10, 12, 14, 4, 22, 24, 26, 6, 500}, k = 2
Output: 4
First we can remove: {10,12,14} and {22,24,26}
Second we can remove: {2,4,6}
Remaining that can't be removed: {100,101,105,500}

Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4}, k = 1
Output: 0
We can actually remove all elements. 
First remove 4, 5, 6 => We get {2, 3, 4}
Now remove 2, 3, 4   => We get empty array {}

Input:  arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 7, 6, 4}, k = 1
Output: 3
We can only remove 2 3 4

Input: arr[] = {1,2},k=1
Output: 2
